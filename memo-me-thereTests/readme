Monday:

XGet your project setup in Objective-C
XCreate a single view controller, that has a map view that takes up most the screen, and 3 buttons below it.
XThe 3 buttons should set the region on the map view to 3 cool locations, you pick the locations.
Implement Stack and Queue in Objective-C. You can implement them in the same project as your map app is in, since Objective-C does not support playgrounds.

Tuesday:

XUsing core location, display the users location on the map
XAdd a long press gesture to the map view
XOn long press,  add an annotation onto the map view, which has a callout with an accessory button
XUpon pressing the accessory button, segue to a AddReminderDetailViewController
Wednesday

XUsing Region monitoring & local notifications, schedule a location based reminder in the AddReminderDetailViewController
XAdd a visual map annotation wherever a reminder is added, using NSNotificationCenter to communicate from the Detail view controller back to the primary map view controller

Thursday

XCreate a WatchKit extension for your app, that will display the regions that are being monitored. Use the watch kit map view to show where the region actually is.
